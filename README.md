## Google-Reviews-Restautant-Analysis Repository

# Introduction

This is the first Data Science project I created on my own. The idea for the project is to analyze Google reviews of a restaurant I have been to when I was in Barcelona last winter. Despite having decent reviews (the score was 4.4 if I remember correctly) the food was terrible. Being a person who cares about food quality I wanted to find out if I could find hints of manipulated reviews.

The goals of the project are as follows.

- Work with real data to answer an interesting question that I personally care about
- Show what I've learned so far in the following areas.
  - Python basics (functions, lists, loops, conditions, list comprehension, datetime objects,import csv files etc.)
  - Exploratory Data Analysis with Pandas, Pyplot and Seaborn (feature engineering, data visualization)
  - Natural language processing with NLTK
  - Jupyter Notebook (on Windows using Ubuntu on WSL)
  - Git and Github

# Obtaining Data

I was looking for the API for Google reviews, but I soon found out that the API allows 5 reviews only. Since I did not want to invest time to learn how to scrape data myself I used the Outscraper service (https://outscraper.com/). With this I was able to get all the reviews for the restaurant in a csv file.
